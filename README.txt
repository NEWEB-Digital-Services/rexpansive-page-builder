### REXPANSIVE - The Page Builder with the maximum fluidity.

Thanks to the evolved smoothness you can move and resize on the fly blocks with photos, texts, videos and much more, on an advanced matrix. The system will also help you to correct alignments and placements, guaranteeing a balance between creativity and design, avoiding annoying attempts to make adjustments.

### Real-time update directly on the public part, allowing you to save time.

We know that it is frustrating to move from the reserved to the public part in order to understand the effective changes. Now you will see them immediately, with numerous features at your fingertips.

### Add or change your models  & Buttons.

You can choose your models, update them, create them, delete them and even synchronise them!

### Synchronise your sections or make them independent.

You can finally decide to make a synchronised section on all the other pages, or you can decide to insert it and make it independent.

### An advanced responsive.

In this way, each device will have photos, videos, texts and the layout it deserves.
On certain devices, such as the mobile phone, photos or layouts, they have much more impact if set vertically rather than in landscape mode, definitely making them better suited to the desktop.

### Changing the text will be child’s play!

You can edit and draft your text, apply a colour, set the type of font, align it, modify the html, insert images and much more!

### Flexible or ordered, layouts made just for you.

The idea is to allow two modes of display, ordered or flexible: you can create an ordered display grid, known as “grid”, in which it is the system itself that keeps the elements organized and aligned, or a flexible display, known as “masonry”, with which your photos will maintain their original proportions, so they will always be totally accurate in every respect and Rexpansive will manage the rest.

### Feel free  to change thanks to cancellation.

Thanks to the “Cancel” function you can decide to change your current version, returning to the previous changes and viewing the changes in real time.

### Upload your SVG icons and modify them to your liking.

Once you have uploaded your icons in SVG format, you can decide whether to resize and colour them with thousands of colours. That way, there will be no limit to your creativity.

### Rexslider. The quick & easy slider!

You can create your sliders quickly by inserting them directly into the blocks. You can benefit from the use of the Rexpansive Builder expansion to customise the size swiftly and rapidly !o)

### Collapse! One over the other, in a click!

You can decide to “collapse” all your content, such as photos, texts, videos and much more, with a simple click, placing them one after the other thanks to the “collapse! function.

### Instant. Create faster than the speed of light.

We have eliminated a significant number of tools; everything is now lighter, and performance is better thanks to expansion. You can now create and view the result in an instant.

### Compatible with any theme.

Rexpansive Builder is designed on a massive scale in order to be compatible with your theme. Furthermore, the system is compatible with the most recent browsers and also with older ones, so that you can feel comfortable even on the public side. Obviously, the Rexpansive Builder plugin works perfectly with all themes when a third-party Page Builder is not active.

### More control. More freedom.

You will be able to customize the CSS of every single page. In this way, customisation will be unlimited and will guarantee that you can always do whatever you want.

### Clean interface. The functions will appear only when needed, to offer you a truly relaxing experience.

Our dedication to design has allowed us to create a simple and functional user experience. In fact, the interface will prove to be clean right from the start.
